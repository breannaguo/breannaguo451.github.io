    "- Delete the first two cells of the notebook (i.e. this one and the raw cell above). \n",
    "- Briefly review the goals you set for yourself in our [goal-setting activity](goal-setting.ipynb) at the beginning of the course. You can find your goals on Canvas. \n",
    "- In the [The Data](#the-data) section, replace the blanks with brief responses. \n",
    "- In the [What you Learned](#what-you-learned) and [Reflecting on Goals](#reflecting-on-goals) sections, write down your reflections on your learning, achievement, and presence in CSCI 0451 in the provided markdown cells. \n",
    "- Take some time to reflect on your responses so far. When you're ready, move on to [propose the letter grade](#your-proposed-letter-grade) that you feel best reflects your learning, participation, and achievement in CSCI 0451. \n",
