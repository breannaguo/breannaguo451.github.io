    "*In this section I'll ask you to fill in some data. You don't have to give precise numbers -- approximate, conversational responses are fine. For example, when I ask \"how often have you attended class,\" good answers include \"almost always,\" \"I've missed three times,\" \"about 75% of the time,\" \"not as often as I want,\" etc.* \n",

    "\n",
    "- *How often have you attended class? (e.g. \"almost always,\" \"I missed three times,\" etc.)* I have attended every class except one, when I attended a conference.\n",
    "- *How often have you taken notes on the core readings ahead of the class period?* I do the readings, I don't necessarily take notes unless for personal reasons.\n",
    "- *How often have you been **prepared** to present the daily warm-up exercise to your team, even if you weren't actually called?* I have most always been prepared to engage in the warm-up exercise.\n",
    "- *How many times have you **actually** presented the daily warm-up to your team?* I've lead a couple of times, and we've done group discussions a number of times as well when I wasn't leader.\n",
    "- *How many times have you asked your team for help while presenting the daily warm-up?* I have had questions about the warmup when presenting.\n",
    "- *How often have you learned something new from a teammate's presentation of the daily warm-up?* Almost every class\n",
    "- *How often have you helped a teammate during the daily warm-up presentation?* Once or twice. We will often discuss how we approached the question.\n",

I'm getting to a point where the data is usable, and once it's usable, all I have to do it type of some lines of code to run the regressions.
